# hand-digit-classifier
In this project I develop a hand digit classifier with Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow 2.0. The dataset is taken from [this repo](https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset).

To use this code please install tensorflow beforehand. I did not included in the `requirements.txt` file because this way you can choose whether to installe it with GPU support.
